# Chess problem

The problem is to find all unique configurations of a set of normal chess pieces on a chess board with
dimensions MÃ—N where none of the pieces is in a position to take any of the others. Providing the number of
results is useful, but not enough to complete the assignment. Assume the colour of the piece does not
matter, and that there are no pawns among the pieces.

The program takes as input:
* The dimensions of the board: M, N
* The number of pieces of each type (King, Queen, Bishop, Rook and Knight) to try and place on the board.

As output, the program  lists all the unique configurations to the console for which all of the pieces can be placed on the board without threatening each other.
